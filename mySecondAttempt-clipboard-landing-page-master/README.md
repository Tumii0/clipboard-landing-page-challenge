# Frontend Mentor - Clipboard landing page

![Design preview for the Clipboard landing page coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## The challenge

My challenge was to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.
 
 ## What I learnt
- how to allow users view the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
